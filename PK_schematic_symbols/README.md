# PK_schematic_symbols

These are custom symbols that I use for drawing schematics in LTspice fo r notes etc. I then typically convert them to svg with `ltspice_to_svg`. 

If you want to use them, put them in `~/Library/Application Support/LTspice/lib/sym` on a MAC OS. They can be used on a PC as well but you will have to look up where to place them.
